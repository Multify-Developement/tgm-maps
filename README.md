# TGM Maps
The maps and active rotation used on the Minehut [Warzone](https://warz.one) server.
Maps in this repository are exclusively setup to work with [TGM](https://github.com/Warzone/TGM) (Team Game Manager) and run on the latest version of Minecraft.

**NOTE:** This repository is no longer maintained, and support may be limited. Map development efforts have moved to [PublicMaps](https://github.com/Warzone/PublicMaps) to support Warzone's transition to [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM).

## Updating the Repo
When adding or modifying any map in this repo, please note some of the requirements we have for our maps.

### Updated World

When adding a map, please make sure the world is updated and compatible with the **latest** version of Minecraft.
- You can figure out what version the world is by loading it into your Single Player Menu

- If the world is not updated to latest version of Minecraft, you can do so by manually loading the map in a newer version of Minecraft.

**NOTE:** When updating the world version, you **cannot** skip version 1.12.2. If the world is 1.12.2 or older, please load it in a 1.12.2 Minecraft client first, before loading it in the latest Minecraft version.

### Pruned Map

The map needs to be pruned for it to be accepted into the repo. 
- This means that **all** chunks excluding the map itself should be deleted from the world.
- You can do this by using a program such as [MCASelector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector) to select and delete all the chunks that aren't apart of the map.
- After pruning the map, please make sure that you **only** include the required world files (`level.dat`, `map.json`, `region/*`).

**NOTE:** When using MCASelector, please make sure you select the region folder to open the world, not the whole folder.

### Additional Requirements
- You must include a valid `map.json` file (This file is used to define the coordinates and teams for the plugin).
- Ensure the map you are adding has a **commercial license**, meaning we have full permission to add the map and use it on our server.
- In the JSON, you must include **all** builders that have helped build the map a significant amount.
	- Make sure the usernames you include in the ``authors`` section of the JSON has the builder's current username.

## Tips
If you need any additional support with writing a map.json or anything else, you can try checking out our [docs](https://docs.warz.one) or by contacting a *Map Developer* on our Discord server located [here](https://warz.one/discord).

## Acknowledgements
This repository represents the years of efforts by Warzone staff, map developers, and TGM contributors. Without them, none of this would have been possible. Kudos to them for their great work maintaining Warzone's maps.
